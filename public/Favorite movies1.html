            The 5E is a a campy and fun take on what it feels like to be so
            important in your own eyes. I love the fashion and the concept that
            the human race is it's own last hope and that therefore, we need to
            protect and love eachother and be there for one antoher.ü•π

            She really was a girls girl. I appreciate that she really just went
            for who she wanted when she wanted. Like, it's a bit mad that she
            didn't care about the white people attacking her tribe but like I
            stan that when she chose her type she stood 10 toes down. lol go
            girl

            >I truly feel this movie was my BAD BITCH awakening. Like I loved
            the come back story with red like she truly was eating but then her
            fake friend found the same salvation but honestly, I loved the movie
            it was so dark and sexy and funny how they truly foudn love in
            eachother and then in the end their vanity was their downfall. haha
            just nostalgic and dramatic üíù
